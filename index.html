            <h2>Breaking News</h2>
            <p>Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram on Thursday said he was unhappy with the way the Ruchika Girhotra molestation case had been investigated.
                "I am unhappy with the way charges were framed and the probe was conducted," Chidambaram said.
                The minister said Ruchika's family had told him they intended to file another FIR against former Haryana DGP S.P.S. Rathore for abetment of suicide. "I will react on the matter if such an FIR is filed," he said.</p>

            <h2>Technology News</h2>
            <p>Microsoft-owned LinkedIn announced more job cuts yesterday, affecting about 668 positions across its engineering, product, talent, and finance teams. The job cuts were cited as necessary as part of the company's focus on streamlining its operations amid Microsoft's experiencing slow revenue growth for eight consecutive quarters. <br>

                In India in particular, Byju's, one of the prominent edtech startups, recently laid off 4,000-5,000 employees as part of business restructuring exercises. However, the news around job cuts is not surprising, given that the IT industry, including big tech firms and startups, has been steadily laying off tech workers at a shocking rate for the past two years. Statistics reveal that, on average, 23 techies have lost their jobs every hour.

            <h2>Sports Update</h2>
            <p>Gill returned to the Indian side for their blockbuster clash against Pakistan and scored 16 runs in Ahmedabad. Gill was diagnosed with dengue fever, which caused him to miss India's first two World Cup matches, which they won against Australia and Afghanistan. Ishan Kishan took his place alongside captain Rohit Sharma as India second opening batter. <br>
                Gill’s return to the side for the rest of the tournament will be a huge boost for India, given his form this year. Having already won the Player of the Month award for January, Gill beat his compatriot Mohammed Siraj and England opener Dawid Malan to win the ICC Men's Player of the Month Award for the second time in the year. <br>
                Gill was named as the Player of the Month in September 2023 for his performances in India's Asia Cup triumph and their ODI series win against Australia. Shubman Gill also became the first Indian cricketer to win the ICC Player of the Award more than once.</p>
